[PBIX file can be found here](Pizza-Database-to-Dashboard-Dashboard.pbix)

In this project I used MySQL to create a database for a fictional pizza place then connected it with PopSQL for querying and management. Then I connected this database to PowerBI so that I could analyize the insights for a fictional manager of this pizza place. Check out my other repository here for more information about how it was created and the data I used in each table of the database.

I get very in-depth into how I created the project from scratch in the followin [repository](https://github.com/SGerk5015/Pizza-Database-to-Dashboard)
