Highlight: Used DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor to create a model which predicts the prices of Soccer Teams in Europe

In this post I would like to talk about my first machine learning project which I completed over Summer 2024.

I created the project off of data I found on Kaggle.com and the dataset is on European Soccer Team data. The project sought to use two different machine learning models to try to predict the price of a European Soccer team. The model had an error of 1.16 billion pounds, while it was nowhere close to accurate, it did serve as a useful learning project.
