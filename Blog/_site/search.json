The key demographics I focused on were geography, gender, age, and membership status. In the dashboard I included elements like slicers so that the audience could interact with the dashboard to better understand the different churn rate across demographics. Specifically, the geography and age breakdown pages both include slicers so that the audience could interact with the page and gain more insights. In the last page of the dashboard I included the three more visuals which I felt best summarized the insights found in the dashboard, specifically the table shows the gender, geography, and age range of different customers sorted by their churn rate. This information along with the count of Customerid, which shows how many customers are in the specific group, can provide insights to the biggest demographics that leave the bank. For some future work in this dashboard, I could review the estimated salary and number of products variables."

The project sought to use two different machine learning models to try to predict the price of a European Soccer team. The model had an error of 1.16 billion pounds, while it was nowhere close to accurate, it did serve as a useful learning project."
