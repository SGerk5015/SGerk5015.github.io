## Education
 - Data Science Student @ Florida Polytechnic University

## Work Experience
**Orientation Leader  Florida Polytechnic University (May 2024 - Present)**
- Facilitated the transition of new students to the university by leading interactive classes and a campus tour. Then provided personalised guidance for these students throughout their first year at the university.

**Lifeguard @ Campo Family YMCA (June 2021- August 2022)**
- Monitored and enforced pool safety rules, identified and addressed potential hazards, and conducted daily audits of safety equipment functionality to ensure compliance with the standards of the YMCA.

## Projects
 **Bank Churn Analysis using PowerBI**

 [Dataset can be found here](Churn-Modelling.xlsx)

 Using PowerBI, I analysed bank churn rates and created visuals of the rates. The visuals contain the geographic and gender breakdown within those who leave the bank. The goal of this project is to visualise possible weaknesses in the bank's marketing or provided services for those groups which have a higher than average churn rate.

**Exploratory Data Analysis in R**

[Dataset used can be found here](Cleaned_DS_Jobs)

 Using R I analyzed a dataset of glassdoor.com data science job postings to see the most common skills, the correlations between these skills, most common industries, and most common states from these job postings. I was able to do this with the tidyverse library.

**Soccer Team Price Prediction**

 [Code can be found here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/samgerken/random-forest-regressor-model)

 [Dataset can be found here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashadrmammadov/football-teams-price-prediction/data)

 Using machine learning libraries like DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor created a model which predicts the prices of Soccer Teams in Europe from the dataset. While the final prediction does have a large amount of error, it is a step to understanding machine learning concepts so that more advanced models can be later built.
