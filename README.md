## Education
 - Data Science Student @ Florida Polytechnic University

## Work Experience
**Orientation Leader  Florida Polytechnic University (May 2024 - Present)**
- Facilitated the transition of new students to the university by leading interactive classes and a campus tour. Then provided personalised guidance for these students throughout their first year at the university.

**Lifeguard @ Campo Family YMCA (June 2021 - August 2022)**
- Monitored and enforced pool safety rules, identified and addressed potential hazards, and conducted daily audits of safety equipment functionality to ensure compliance with the standards of the YMCA.

## Projects
 **Bank Churn Analysis using PowerBI**

 [Dataset can be found here](Churn-Modelling.xlsx)

 Using PowerBI, I analyzed the churn rate of a fictional bankâ€™s customers across different key demographics. The key demographics I focused on were geography, gender, age, and membership status. In the dashboard I included elements like slicers so that the audience could interact with the dashboard to better understand the different churn rate across demographics. Specifically, the geography and age breakdown pages both include slicers so that the audience could interact with the page and gain more insights. In the last page of the dashboard I included the three more visuals which I felt best summarized the insights found in the dashboard, specifically the table shows the gender, geography, and age range of different customers sorted by their churn rate. This information along with the count of Customerid, which shows how many customers are in the specific group, can provide insights to the biggest demographics that leave the bank. For some future work in this dashboard, I could review the estimated salary and number of products variables.

**Exploratory Data Analysis in R**

[Dataset used can be found here](Cleaned_DS_Jobs)

 Using R I analyzed a dataset of glassdoor.com data science job postings to see the most common skills, the correlations between these skills, most common industries, and most common states from these job postings. I was able to do this by using the tidyverse library.

**Soccer Team Price Prediction**

 [Dataset can be found here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashadrmammadov/football-teams-price-prediction/data)

 Using machine learning libraries like DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor created a model which predicts the prices of Soccer Teams in Europe from the dataset. While the final prediction does have a large amount of error, it is a step to understanding machine learning concepts so that more advanced models can be later built.
