## Projects
**Pizza Database to Dashboard** 

 [PBIX can be found here](Pizza-Database-to-Dashboard-Dashboard.pbix)

 [SQL can be found here](Pizza-Database-to-Dashboard-Dashboard.sql)

In this project I used MySQL to create a database for a fictional pizza place then connected it with PopSQL for querying and management. Then I connected this database to PowerBI so that I could analyize the insights for a fictional manager of this pizza place. Check out my other repository [here](https://github.com/SGerk5015/Pizza-Database-to-Dashboard/tree/main) for more information about how it was created and the data I used in each table of the database.

 **Bank Churn Analysis using PowerBI**

 [Dataset can be found here](Churn-Modelling.xlsx)

 Using PowerBI, I analyzed the churn rate of a fictional bankâ€™s customers across different key demographics. The key demographics I focused on were geography, gender, age, and membership status. In the dashboard I included elements like slicers so that the audience could interact with the dashboard to better understand the different churn rate across demographics. Specifically, the geography and age breakdown pages both include slicers so that the audience could interact with the page and gain more insights. In the last page of the dashboard I included the three more visuals which I felt best summarized the insights found in the dashboard, specifically the table shows the gender, geography, and age range of different customers sorted by their churn rate. This information along with the count of Customerid, which shows how many customers are in the specific group, can provide insights to the biggest demographics that leave the bank. For some future work in this dashboard, I could review the estimated salary and number of products variables.

**Exploratory Data Analysis in R**

[html can be found here](Glassdoor_EDA.nb.html)

[Rmd can be found here](Glassdoor_EDA.Rmd)

[Dataset used can be found here](Cleaned_DS_Jobs)

 Using R I analyzed a dataset of glassdoor.com data science job postings to see the most common skills, the correlations between these skills, most common industries, and most common states from these job postings. I was able to do this by using the tidyverse library.

**Soccer Team Price Prediction**

 [Code can be found here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/samgerken/random-forest-regressor-model)

 [Dataset can be found here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashadrmammadov/football-teams-price-prediction/data)

 Using machine learning libraries like DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor created a model which predicts the prices of Soccer Teams in Europe from the dataset. While the final prediction does have a large amount of error, it is a step to understanding machine learning concepts so that more advanced models can be later built.
