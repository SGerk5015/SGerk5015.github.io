#### Florida Poly 'Hackathons'
October 13th, 2023

 Randomly placed in a team and collaborated to code and build a functioning mechanical arm which could successfully
move small wooden blocks into a cup


February 29th, 2024

 Randomly placed in a team and given an etch e sketch and components which were used to create a joystick system 
which controlled the etch e sketch. Excel was also incorporated which tracked the direction the joystick traveled
in and graphed the shape being drawn

#### Data Science Projects
 **European Football Team Price Prediction:**
 
   Using a dataset on European Football Teams and their prices I used DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor to create a Machine Learning Model to predict the price of the Teams based of the total revenue of the team, the stadium capacity, average attendance, and the market value of the players. Both models were largely unsuccsesful as the DecisionTreeRegressor had a mean absolute error of 1.5 billion Dollars and the RandomForestRegressor had a mean absolute error of 1.1 Billion Dollars. Code can be found [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/samgerken/random-forest-regressor-model)
